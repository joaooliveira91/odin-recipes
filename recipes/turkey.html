        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh garlic</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Italian herb seasoning blend</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 (1/2 pound) turkey tenderloins</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary or other herbs for garnish (optional)</li>
            <li>1 lemon, sliced for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, Italian herbs, salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Squeeze the bag to mix the contents. Add turkey tenderloins, remove as much air as possible, seal the bag, and move tenderloins inside the bag until coated with marinade. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to 8 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a nonstick, ovenproof skillet over medium heat. When the oil shimmers, remove turkey from marinade and sear until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Bake in the skillet in the center of the preheated oven until tenderloin is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 12 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). See note.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and tent with foil to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Check temperature again with an instant-read thermometer; tenderloins should reach 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) from residual heat. </li>
            <li>Slice, garnish with fresh herbs and lemon slices, and serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
